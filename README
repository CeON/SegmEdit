About SegmEdit
==============

SegmEdit allows to browse and edit XML files (in TrueViz format) containing
information about structure of PDF documents (words, lines, zones) and about
zones' classification (title, author, abstract, etc.) One of the components
of the solution is a server responsible for distribution of documents to be
processed.

SegmEdit was created in order to create a test suite for page segmentation
and zone classification algorithms, which are part of a metadata extraction
framework developed at CeON.

It is an open source software, wrote in Python using wxWidgets library and
ImageMagick software suite.
