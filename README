About SegmEdit
==============

SegmEdit allows to browse and edit XML files (in TrueViz format) containing
information about structure of PDF documents (words, lines, zones) and about
zones' classification (title, author, abstract, etc.) One of the components
of the solution is a server responsible for distribution of documents to be
processed.

SegmEdit was created in order to create a test suite for page segmentation
and zone classification algorithms, which are part of a metadata extraction
framework developed at CeON.

It is an open source software, wrote in Python using wxWidgets library and
ImageMagick software suite.


Dependencies

How to run
==========

** SegmEdit GUI:

1. Change directory to SegmEditGUI
2. Type ./segmedit.py

** SegmServer:

To use the application, there's no need to run server. 

You have to prepare a sqlite3 database called doaj.db with a table:

create table article (url TEXT, atitle TEXT, authors TEXT,
    fileid TEXT, year TEXT, volume TEXT, issue TEXT, pages TEXT);

Put into this table informations about all files you have. The field 
'fileid' must contain the filename without extension. The field 'atitle'
is recommended, all the rest is optional.

Put your pdf files into directory 'pdfs', as '<fileid>.pdf', and the xml 
files into directory 'xmls', as '<fileid>.xml'. 

Type ./sync.pl to create a 'db.sqlite' file. Re-run this file after changes 
in 'pdfs' and 'xmls' directories.

Type ./server.py to run a server.
